Kev was a language to auto be imported by a library to generate lexing and parsing code, this was when the language also included language development as a planned feature, this might either be abandoned or included as a package

# Tokens

```python
!TokenTree
Tokens:
	# `$` denotes any character
	Print = "print"
	Comment = r"//.*\n" | "/*" + $ +"*/"
	Identifier = r"[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Za0-9]*"
	#Tokens can be nested
	Literal:
		Integer = '0'..='9' 
		Float   = r"[+-]?[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?"
		String  = '\"' + $ + '\"'
		Bool    = [True = "true", False = "false"]
	#Tokens can be nested as many times as needed
	Operator:
		Math:
			Add = '+'
			Sub = '-'
			Mul = '*'
			Div = '/'
		Bool:
			And = "and"
			OR  = "or"
			Not = "not"
		Equality =  {'!'| '='} + '='			
	#Tokens can take sub tokens
	#The `?` Denotes that a token is optional
	Assign(o = Operator.Math? | EQ | NE) = o + '='
	LeftParen  = '('
	RightParen = ')'
	Test = 
```

# AST

```python
import * from Tokens
import * from Literal

!EAST
Expr:
	ValueLiteral = Integer | Float | String | Bool
	#By making `l` an optional, we can imitate an unary expression now
	Binary = Expr + {Operator o where o is not Operator.Bool.Not} + Expr
	Unary  = {Operator.Math.Sub | Operator.Bool.Not} + Expr
	Variable = Identifier

!SAST
Stmt:
	Output = Print + Expr
```
